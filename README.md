# esp8266_weather

This is a weather app which queries http://api.shoulditakeanumbrella.com/ and lights up different
LEDs to show when you might need to take an umbrella with you.  It is triggered by a motion sensor.
So, it can be positioned next to a door way to remind you that you might want to take an umbrella
with you when you leave.
